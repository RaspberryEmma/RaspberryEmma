I am a postgrad student with the University of Southampton, currently enrolled in "MSc Operational Research and Statistics".
I'm currently learning various OR techniques for optimisation and data handling, with an interest towards probability theory and modelling.

Mainly, I'm looking for opportunities to get to contribute to open-source projects as a means of sharpening my programming skills.
I consider myself proficient with:
 - Python
 - Java
 - Haskell
 - C++
 - R
 - LaTeX

Pronouns: she / her
