I am a PhD student with the University of Bristol, currently enrolled in "Computational Statistics and Data Science".
I'm currently learning the basics of epidimiology, alongside the theory underpinning it's mathematical techniques.

My main research interests are healthcare modelling, healthcare waiting times estimation, causal health analysis and health equity.

I consider myself proficient with:
 - Python
 - Java
 - Haskell
 - C++
 - R / RStudio
 - LaTeX $ 27^{5} + 84^{5} + 110^{5} + 133^{5} = 144^{5} $

Feel free to DM me if you want to chat maths, and I hope to be able to answer whatever questions you have.
